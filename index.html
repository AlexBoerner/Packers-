   <h2>The Packers History 
           1919-1966</h2>
   <center><p1>The Packers started in 1919 and they were founded by Curly Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun. The Packers started off playing teams from Michigan and Wisconsin. The Packers eventually started winning and put it all together to win there first NFL Championship.The Packers won 12 more championships they were in 1930,1931,1936,1939,1944,1961,1962,1965,1966,1967,1996 and the most recent one 2010.</p1></center>

   <center><h2> The Packers History 1967 to 1992</h2></center>
    <center><p1>In 1967 the Green Bay Packers won their last superbowl with Vince Lombardi and their last Superbowl for a long time. After the 1967 superbowl Vince Lobmbardi left the Packers and retired after 2 years with the redSkins.Later he passed away on September,3rd 1970. After Vince left the Packers were doining terrible they only had 5 winning season up untell 1992.They had 5 diffrent coaches in this era. But in 1992 everything changed with a QB from Mississippi got traded to the Packers his name was Brett Favre.</p1></center>

   <center><h2>The Packers History 1992 to 2008</h2></center>
   <center><p1>Brett Favre so little known that the Atlanta Falcons Announcer for the Draft said is last name wrong. The only thing he was known for was on his first ever pass he threw a interception!Brett Favre a liitle known boy from Mississippi would change everything for the Packers. In Brett Favres first ever game as a Packers his first throw was a interception to HIMSELF! But even though he threw a lot of interception he was good really good and he got noticed and he played great. In 1996 the Packers won their first superbowl or championship in 29 years!. The Packers would make it to another Superbowl the next year but would lose to the Denver Broncos! The Packers were never the same after that and in 2007 Brett Favre retired but then he came out of it and went to the Jets. Then he went to the Packers rivel the Vikings.Packers fans hated this and burned it Jersey. But the Packers front offince was not worried they were working on another young QB named Aaron Rodgers! </p1></center>

   <center><h2>The Packers History 2008 to Present</h2></center>
   <center><p1>The Packers drafted Aaron Rodgers in 2005 but had not played him untell the 2009 season. Aaron Rodgers in his first season did alright a good record of 11-5 they made the playoff and did not do good in the playoffs. The next year was the Packers year they went 10-5 and just made it into the playoffs as aa 6th seed they made it all the way to the Superbowl and beat the  Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25, becoming the first No. 6 seed from the NFC to win a Super Bowl. After this the Packers have not been to the superbowl but they have made the playoffs every year and made it to 2 NFC championship teams and I have a felling there are more in the Green Bay Packers Future!</p1></center>
